### How to Use

Type a word in the input box and you should see the definition(s) appear below.

Iota after a long vowel can be written either as subscript or not:
`ᾗπερ` and `ἧιπερ` are both valid.

If you include accents, breathing, and the iota subscript,
then they will be included in the search. If you leave them out, it will try to find all
potential matches.

You can also use Latin characters. The romanization is pretty flexible.
For example, `heiper`, `heper`, `eiper`, and `eper` all work for `ᾗπερ`.
